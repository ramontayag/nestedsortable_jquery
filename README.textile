h1. Nested Sortable - jQuery

This is "mjsarfatti.com's":http://mjsarfatti.com/sandbox/nestedSortable/ nested sortable with a few changes:

h2. Change 1: serialize

Serialize now supports the position or order of items as well. This hasn't been tested vigorously (I don't know what configuration options might not work), but it has changed from:

<pre>
itemName[23]=12
</pre>

to

<pre>
itemName[itemName_23][position]=0&itemName[itemName_23][parent_id]=itemName_12
</pre>

And this is how you'd parse through the returned params to your server in Ruby assuming your itemName is 'page':

<pre>
params['page'].each do |page_id, attributes|
  id = page_id.gsub(/\D+/, "") # get ID for integer only
  page = Page.find(id)
  page.position = attributes['position']
  page.parent_id = attributes['parent_id'].gsub(/\D+/, "")
  page.save
end
</pre>
